    question: "How does Sahayog Nepal work?",
    answer: "Sahayog Nepal is a crowdfunding platform where individuals and organizations can create campaigns to raise funds for various causes. Donors can browse campaigns, make donations, and track the progress. Campaign creators receive funds once their campaign ends successfully."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of campaigns can I create?",
    answer: "You can create campaigns for various causes including education, healthcare, disaster relief, community development, heritage preservation, environmental initiatives, and more. All campaigns must comply with our guidelines and be verifiable."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know campaigns are legitimate?",
    answer: "We have a verification process for all campaigns. This includes identity verification of campaign creators, documentation of the cause, and regular updates required from funded campaigns. We also encourage transparency through photos, videos, and detailed descriptions."
  },
  {
    question: "What fees does Sahayog Nepal charge?",
    answer: "Sahayog Nepal takes no platform fee from any funded campaigns to cover operational costs until you intend to. Payment processors may charge additional fees (typically 2-3%). We're committed to keeping fees low to maximize the impact of donations."
  },
  {
    question: "When do campaign creators receive the funds?",
    answer: "Campaign creators receive funds only after their bank account has been verified. Before a campaign ends, early withdrawals are allowed only if the campaign balance reaches at least Rs 10,000 and the bank account is verified. When a campaign ends, creators can withdraw any amount (including sums below Rs 10,000) once bank verification is complete. Withdrawals are typically processed within 5–7 business days; expedited verification is available for urgent cases."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I create a campaign on behalf of someone else?",
    answer: "Yes, you can create a campaign to help someone else, but you must have their permission and be transparent about your relationship with the beneficiary. We may require documentation and direct contact with the beneficiary during verification."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
    answer: "We accept various payment methods including credit/debit cards, eSewa, Khalti, ConnectIPS, and bank transfers. We're constantly working to add more payment options to make donating as convenient as possible for all Nepalis."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my donation tax-deductible?",
    answer: "Donations made through Sahayog Nepal may be tax-deductible depending on the nature of the campaign and current tax laws in Nepal. We provide donation receipts that can be used for tax purposes, but we recommend consulting with a tax professional."
